# My Presentations

Welcome to the repository of my school projects. 
This repository contains a collection of my previous PowerPoint presentations. 
Some of them include animations, so view them in slideshow mode to see the effects.

## Installation and Usage

To view the presentations, you'll need Microsoft PowerPoint or a compatible application that supports `.pptx` files.

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**
   - You can download the ZIP file of this repository from GitHub or clone it using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/discothech/My-Presentations-ppt.git
     ```

2. **Open the Presentation**
   - Navigate to the folder where the presentations are located:
     ```bash
     cd My-Presentations-ppt
     ```
   - Open the desired `.pptx` file with Microsoft PowerPoint or another compatible viewer.

Hope you will like it! (〃＾▽＾〃)
